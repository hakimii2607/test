                    But I want you to know that I am still loving you with all my heart as the same. I know I cannot and I never be perfect, sometimes I got mad or sad and have showed you my bad side. But I want you to know that I never want to act like that to you.

I am so sorry if it makes you annoyed or uncomfortable.
                    I just want to feel safe and loved by you. I really love you and I don't want to lose you.</p>
